Calibration results (with uncertainties):

Focal Length:          fc = [ 1578.96062   1587.68541 ] ± [ 21.93023   21.81168 ]
Principal point:       cc = [ 762.26178   1042.90600 ] ± [ 7.35144   13.99538 ]
Skew:             alpha_c = [ 0.00000 ] ± [ 0.00000  ]   => angle of pixel axes = 90.00000 ± 0.00000 degrees
Distortion:            kc = [ 0.11185   -0.32310   0.00253   0.00150  0.00000 ] ± [ 0.01279   0.05791   0.00159   0.00193  0.00000 ]
Pixel error:          err = [ 0.42075   0.45516 ]

Note: The numerical errors are approximately three times the standard deviations (for reference).
